## Task 7: Support Vector Machines (SVM)

### 🔍 Objective
Explore the power of SVMs for binary classification using both linear and non-linear kernels.

### ⚙️ Tools
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn (for heatmaps)
- ROC-AUC analysis

### 🚀 Key Features
- Trained SVM using linear, RBF, and polynomial kernels.
- Visualized decision boundaries with 2D features.
- Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
- Evaluated using Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC, and Cross-Validation.

### Results
- RBF kernel outperformed linear with higher AUC.
- Polynomial kernel gave slightly overfit results.
- Best performance with full feature set and tuned parameters.
